        "This project explores whether **estimated country-level caffeine intake** is related to **mental health and mortality outcomes** around the world. Instead of just looking at simple correlations, the analysis will use regression models to see if caffeine intake is associated with outcomes like depression burden or all-cause mortality after accounting for important factors such as GDP per capita, smoking rates, alcohol use, and regional differences. Because the data is at the country level, results will be interpreted as population-level patterns rather than individual cause-and-effect.\n",

        "\n",
        "### A. Data Collection\n",
        " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
        " \n",
        " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because our primary analysis is ecological (country-level), the key “collection bias” risks include differences in how consumption is measured across countries, differences in reporting quality, and differences in how health outcomes are recorded. We will document how each source defines its variables and include sensitivity checks and cautious interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "We plan to use aggregated country-level data only. No personally identifiable information is needed or collected.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
        "\n",
        "### B. Data Storage\n",
        " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
        " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
        " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "### C. Analysis\n",
        " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
        "\n",
        "A major risk is ecological fallacy (over-interpreting country-level correlations as individual-level causation). We will clearly frame results as associations at the country level and avoid causal claims.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will control for plausible confounders (e.g., GDP per capita, smoking, alcohol use) and will report  where confounding cannot be removed. We will also run sensitivity analyses because caffeine intake is estimated rather than directly measured.\n",

        " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",

        " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",

        " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
        " - [X] **D.5 Communicate**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",

        "We will include a  section that emphasizes ecological design constraints, measurement uncertainty in caffeine estimates, and remaining confounding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### E. Deployment\n",
        " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
        " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
        " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
        " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
        "\n",
        "Country-level correlations can be misused to shame or stereotype countries/cultures. We will avoid sensational framing and will emphasize uncertainty and confounding. We will not claim that caffeine causes outcomes, only that country-level variables are associated.\n"
