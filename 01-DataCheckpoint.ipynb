        "Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances worldwide, typically consumed through coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages. Because caffeine affects sleep, mood, and cardiovascular physiology, population-level differences in caffeine intake could plausibly relate to mental health and mortality patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the individual level, observational research has reported associations between caffeine intake and depression-related outcomes. For example, analyses using NHANES data examined caffeine consumption and depression measures, suggesting a relationship may exist, though causality is not established and confounding remains a major concern.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, large observational analyses have examined caffeine intake and all-cause or cause-specific mortality, often identifying non-linear associations and emphasizing careful interpretation and adjustment for confounders.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, most prior work is within-country and individual-level, while our project is between-country and ecological. This makes the question different: we are not claiming caffeine causes outcomes in individuals, but asking whether country-level patterns co-vary and whether those patterns persist after controlling for structural factors (wealth, health system capacity, smoking, alcohol use, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "To estimate country-level caffeine intake, we will start from publicly available per-capita consumption estimates for coffee and tea by country for recent years.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) We will then convert these amounts to approximate caffeine intake using caffeine-content references (acknowledging large variation across preparation methods and products).<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, beverage-market composition data (percent of caffeinated beverage volume sales by category) can help characterize where caffeine is coming from in different countries (coffee vs tea vs carbonates vs energy drinks), which we can use for subgroup and interaction analyses.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",
