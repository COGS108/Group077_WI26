        "Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances worldwide, typically consumed through coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages. Because caffeine affects sleep, mood, and cardiovascular physiology, population-level differences in caffeine intake could plausibly relate to mental health and mortality patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the individual level, observational research has reported associations between caffeine intake and depression-related outcomes. For example, analyses using NHANES data examined caffeine consumption and depression measures, suggesting a relationship may exist, though causality is not established and confounding remains a major concern.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, large observational analyses have examined caffeine intake and all-cause or cause-specific mortality, often identifying non-linear associations and emphasizing careful interpretation and adjustment for confounders.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, most prior work is within-country and individual-level, while our project is between-country and ecological. This makes the question different: we are not claiming caffeine causes outcomes in individuals, but asking whether country-level patterns co-vary and whether those patterns persist after controlling for structural factors (wealth, health system capacity, smoking, alcohol use, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "To estimate country-level caffeine intake, we will start from publicly available per-capita consumption estimates for coffee and tea by country for recent years.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) We will then convert these amounts to approximate caffeine intake using caffeine-content references (acknowledging large variation across preparation methods and products).<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, beverage-market composition data (percent of caffeinated beverage volume sales by category) can help characterize where caffeine is coming from in different countries (coffee vs tea vs carbonates vs energy drinks), which we can use for subgroup and interaction analyses.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

        "\n",
        "### A. Data Collection\n",
        " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
        " \n",
        " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because our primary analysis is ecological (country-level), the key “collection bias” risks include differences in how consumption is measured across countries, differences in reporting quality, and differences in how health outcomes are recorded. We will document how each source defines its variables and include sensitivity checks and cautious interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "We plan to use aggregated country-level data only. No personally identifiable information is needed or collected.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
        "\n",
        "### B. Data Storage\n",
        " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
        " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
        " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "### C. Analysis\n",
        " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
        "\n",
        "A major risk is ecological fallacy (over-interpreting country-level correlations as individual-level causation). We will clearly frame results as associations at the country level and avoid causal claims.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will control for plausible confounders (e.g., GDP per capita, smoking, alcohol use) and will report  where confounding cannot be removed. We will also run sensitivity analyses because caffeine intake is estimated rather than directly measured.\n",

        " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will show uncertainty by reporting results across multiple assumption settings for caffeine conversion factors instead of presenting one “true” caffeine value. We will avoid misleading country ranking visualizations without context.\n",

        "### D. Modeling\n",
        " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",

        " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will report multiple evaluation views (e.g., coefficient estimates + confidence intervals, partial dependence / marginal effects where appropriate, and sensitivity checks) instead of relying on one metric.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
        " - [X] **D.5 Communicate**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",

        "\n",
        "### E. Deployment\n",
        " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
        " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
        " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
        " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
        "\n",
        "Country-level correlations can be misused to shame or stereotype countries/cultures. We will avoid sensational framing and will emphasize uncertainty and confounding. We will not claim that caffeine causes outcomes, only that country-level variables are associated.\n"
