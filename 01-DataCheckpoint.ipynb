        "Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances worldwide, typically consumed through coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages. Because caffeine affects sleep, mood, and cardiovascular physiology, population-level differences in caffeine intake could plausibly relate to mental health and mortality patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the individual level, observational research has reported associations between caffeine intake and depression-related outcomes. For example, analyses using NHANES data examined caffeine consumption and depression measures, suggesting a relationship may exist, though causality is not established and confounding remains a major concern.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, large observational analyses have examined caffeine intake and all-cause or cause-specific mortality, often identifying non-linear associations and emphasizing careful interpretation and adjustment for confounders.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, most prior work is within-country and individual-level, while our project is between-country and ecological. This makes the question different: we are not claiming caffeine causes outcomes in individuals, but asking whether country-level patterns co-vary and whether those patterns persist after controlling for structural factors (wealth, health system capacity, smoking, alcohol use, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "To estimate country-level caffeine intake, we will start from publicly available per-capita consumption estimates for coffee and tea by country for recent years.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) We will then convert these amounts to approximate caffeine intake using caffeine-content references (acknowledging large variation across preparation methods and products).<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, beverage-market composition data (percent of caffeinated beverage volume sales by category) can help characterize where caffeine is coming from in different countries (coffee vs tea vs carbonates vs energy drinks), which we can use for subgroup and interaction analyses.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",

        "We will keep a clear reproducible pipeline in the repository: raw sources, cleaning scripts, a data dictionary, and versioned outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### D. Modeling\n",
        " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
        " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
        " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will report multiple evaluation views (e.g., coefficient estimates + confidence intervals, partial dependence / marginal effects where appropriate, and sensitivity checks) instead of relying on one metric.\n",
        "\n",
        " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
        " - [X] **D.5 Communicate**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
        "\n",
        "We will include a  section that emphasizes ecological design constraints, measurement uncertainty in caffeine estimates, and remaining confounding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### E. Deployment\n",
        " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
        " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
        " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
        " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
        "\n",
        "Country-level correlations can be misused to shame or stereotype countries/cultures. We will avoid sensational framing and will emphasize uncertainty and confounding. We will not claim that caffeine causes outcomes, only that country-level variables are associated.\n"
