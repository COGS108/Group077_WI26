        "Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances worldwide, typically consumed through coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages. Because caffeine affects sleep, mood, and cardiovascular physiology, population-level differences in caffeine intake could plausibly relate to mental health and mortality patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the individual level, observational research has reported associations between caffeine intake and depression-related outcomes. For example, analyses using NHANES data examined caffeine consumption and depression measures, suggesting a relationship may exist, though causality is not established and confounding remains a major concern.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, large observational analyses have examined caffeine intake and all-cause or cause-specific mortality, often identifying non-linear associations and emphasizing careful interpretation and adjustment for confounders.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, most prior work is within-country and individual-level, while our project is between-country and ecological. This makes the question different: we are not claiming caffeine causes outcomes in individuals, but asking whether country-level patterns co-vary and whether those patterns persist after controlling for structural factors (wealth, health system capacity, smoking, alcohol use, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "To estimate country-level caffeine intake, we will start from publicly available per-capita consumption estimates for coffee and tea by country for recent years.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) We will then convert these amounts to approximate caffeine intake using caffeine-content references (acknowledging large variation across preparation methods and products).<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, beverage-market composition data (percent of caffeinated beverage volume sales by category) can help characterize where caffeine is coming from in different countries (coffee vs tea vs carbonates vs energy drinks), which we can use for subgroup and interaction analyses.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
